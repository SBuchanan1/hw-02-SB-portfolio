Overview
This assignment displays a basic portfolio with responsiveness.
For this assignment we were given additional html files to correspond with our root html file to make the webpage responsive. As mentioned in the last activity, the index.html file is the root file that goes to the browser. I added the contact.html and portfolio.html from code that was already provided to us.

I used copied and pasted the base code for all files; index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html. I then went in a changed the contact information and provided a mini biography of myself.
